title: Software Engineering is a Social Science

I consider myself lucky to have been born at a time to see home computers become mainstream. My family's first computer was a TI-99/4A with a broken "6" (obtained by barter—long story) that you had to screw into the antenna jack of your TV to use as a monitor. It would have 16 colors when I managed to commandeer the color TV. I learned to program at an early age because this computer did nothing else: you turn it on and type in BASIC. You turn it off and your program is gone. Rinse, repeat.

I remember very clearly grown-ups disavowing any knowledge of the newfangled things. It sounded like a point of pride to be computer illiterate. There was a stereotype that you had to be under 20 to use a computer (or to set up a VCR), and that stereotype was mostly true due to kids having no ignorance to prove. (We may have also had more spare time, and figuring this stuff out was just a matter of time.) Adults already had a connotation of computers—perhaps as tools of power, room-sized intellectual engines that maintained corporations or government, cold, impersonal, and sinister. If not evil, then beyond good and evil, in a world of pure thought that nullified human values.
