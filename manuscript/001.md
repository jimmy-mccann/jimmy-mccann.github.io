title: Sequel to a Manifesto
---

Almost two decades ago, I started writing what my wife would call my Manifesto—a concise summary of my philosophical and religious beliefs—and I finished it and posted it in 2006. It's [still online](http://pivarski.watson.org/manifesto.html) in all its vintage glory. (My name hasn't changed; I decided to use my maiden name on this book to keep it separate from my work life.) In the Manifesto, I talked about my then-recent conversion from atheism to Catholicism, but it was more about metaphysics than religion. In fact, it was so ambiguous that I received diametrically opposite praise: an evengetical Christian reading group and the president of an atheist society both told me that it was a great argument for or against belief (not sarcastically). What's worse, I can't tell which of them is right.

Thirteen years later, I still can't accept the Scholastic metaphysics that forms the vocabulary of Catholic theology, nor can I think coherently about the mysticism at Catholicism's opposite pole. (That may be the point of mysticism.) There are many different types of Catholics—some have a more evengelical bent, some a Buddhist perspective, and some are conscious of Christianity's pagan roots—I have tried to explain that I'm an atheistic kind of Catholic, but that pair of words has never helped anyone understand what I mean.

The disconnect stems from the fact that I don't see "Does God exist?" as being a question. It assumes that we're settled on the definitions of such words as "God" and "exist" and merely need to determine if they can be used together. People's ideas of what "God" means are so varied that we might as well start with one's assertion that God exists or God does not exist and use that to try to figure out what they mean by "God." For instance, one person may be thinking of God as "he in whom we live and move and have our being," a principle of rationality—creator of the universe in the sense that his mere existence makes 2 + 2 equal to 4 so that specific realities may rise up out of the chaos of existential absurdity. Another may think of God's nonexistence as an assertion that the universe is ruled by physical laws, not the capricious whim of a spirit: the triumph of science and logic. These two people believe the same thing, though one expresses it by saying, "God exists" and the other expresses it by saying, "God does not exist."

WHat I've come to realize in the past decade since the Manifesto is that there are also different things that could be meant by the word "exist."
