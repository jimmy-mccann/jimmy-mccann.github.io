title: Sequel to a Manifesto
---

Almost two decades ago, I started writing what my wife would call my Manifesto—a concise summary of my philosophical and religious beliefs—and I finished it and posted it in 2006. It's [still online](http://pivarski.watson.org/manifesto.html) in all its vintage glory. (My name hasn't changed; I decided to use my maiden name on this book to keep it separate from my work life.) In the Manifesto, I talked about my then-recent conversion from atheism to Catholicism, but it was more about metaphysics than religion. In fact, it was so ambiguous that I received diametrically opposite praise: an evengetical Christian reading group and the president of an atheist society both told me that it was a great argument for or against belief (not sarcastically). What's worse, I can't tell which of them is right.

Thirteen years later, I still can't accept the Scholastic metaphysics that underlies the vocabulary of Catholic theology, nor can I think coherently about the mysticism at Catholicism's opposite pole. (That may be the point of mysticism.) There are many different types of Catholics—some have a more evengelical bent, some a Buddhist perspective, and some are conscious of Christianity's pagan roots—I have tried to explain that I'm an atheistic kind of Catholic, but that pair of words has never helped anyone understand what I mean.

The disconnect stems from the fact that I don't see "Does God exist?" as being a meaningful question. It assumes that we're settled on the definitions of such words as "God" and "exist" and merely need to determine if they can be used together. People's ideas of what "God" means are so varied that we might as well start with one's assertion that God exists or God does not exist and use that to try to figure out what they mean by "God." For instance, one person may be thinking of God as "he in whom we live and move and have our being," a principle of rationality—creator of the universe in the sense that his mere existence makes 2 + 2 equal to 4 so that specific realities may rise up out of the chaos of existential absurdity. Another may think of God's nonexistence as an assertion that the universe is ruled by physical laws, not the capricious whim of a spirit: the triumph of science and logic. These two people believe the same thing, though one expresses it by saying, "God exists" and the other expresses it by saying, "God does not exist."

What I've come to realize in the past decade since the Manifesto is that there are also different things that could be meant by the word "exist." One is physical existence: "Is this a thing in our world, which we can discover by experiment?" This is what people usually mean when they say that something is "real." It is the business of science to identify things in this category, from the platypus to protons.

Next is mathematical existence, the question of whether an idea is logically consistent. When a mathematician says that a solution exists to such-and-such a problem, they mean that there is a valid way to satisfy its constraints. Often, they say this of mathematical "objects." Three-sided triangles exist but four-sided triangles do not. Or to pick an example that's not true by its definition, straight lines that intersect twice in the Euclidean plane do not exist—it requires a little logic beyond the definitions of "straight lines" and "intersect" to see that it can't happen twice, and we have to throw in a qualifier like "in the Euclidean plane" to exclude non-standard but logically consistent concepts of geometry. In Kant's terminology, I'm talking about a priori statements, whether analytic (contained within their definitions) or synthetic (requiring a chain of logical deduction, but still a purely mental exercise). I've been in arguments where someone wants to assert that they only believe in what can be proven by experiment, when I know that they believe in logical statements whose proofs are rational, but independent of experiment.

There have been debates about whether these mathematical objects are real like physical objects, with proponents of all three positions: (a) they're both real, (b) mathematical objects are not real like physical objects, and (c) physical objects are not as real as the mathematical ones. Why can't we just say that they're different categories with neither being "higher" or "more real" than the other? We could adopt stricter language, in which physical things "exist" or "do not exist" and mathematical ones are "valid" or "invalid." The platypus or proton is not more or better because its discovery required information from sources beyond our minds, and equilateral triangles are not more or better because they don't. But also, they're not the same sorts of things—one is not true in the same way that another is true.

Articulation is good. There are different kinds of truth and here are two of them. They mix in practice: scientific discoveries require logical thinking and they are often framed in mathematical language, but the existence of protons is not the same as the quantum field theory that provides a language for talking about such a thing. Mathematicians can claim to be more pure in that the reverse is not true—they can reason about logical forms without mixing them with anything discovered through the senses—but I don't see purity as a goal so much as articulation.

There's a third category. I've heard it said that the third prong of Hume's fork, after matters of fact and relations of ideas, is nonsense. If it's not about the world of the senses, in which truths are identified by consistency, or the world of logic, in which truths are identified by reduction to a grammar, then claims to truth are unhinged and anything may be regarded as true. But anybody who believes that undermines their own beliefs: this third category includes the subjectivity that is the start of all inquiry, the awareness of our own beliefs that must come before listing what they are.

The physical world is a haze of particles—we could scientifically "discover" that they're in some random configuration at one time and another random configuration at another time and never run out of things to discover. But that's not what scientists do. They look for _interesting_ facts about the universe, statements that connect phenomea previously thought to be unrelated or represent exceptions to what was thought to be a general rule. Every scientific discovery is framed as a story.

The mathematical world is an infinitude of possibilities—we could prove logically valid statements about uninteresting numbers forever. But that's not what mathematicians do. They look for _interesting_ relationships, connecting phenomena previously thought to be unrelated or contradictions to what was thought to be correct. Every mathematical theorem is framed as a story.

So in the sense that science is integrated with math and math is uncorrupted by science, both are inexorably mixed with subjectivity about what makes an interesting discovery. You can't take the human elements out of the hard sciences because that would leave the hard sciences with nothing to do. Even a computer cataloging facts is not cataloging facts until a subjective mind interprets what the computer is doing as cataloging facts.

My manifesto from 2006 started with a metaphor: a cat peering out of a paper bag. From the cat's perspective, the ridge of the bag encircles the living room, but we can see that the living room encircles the bag. It was a roundabout way of describing the mind-body problem: do our thinking selves encompass the physical universe or is our ability to think a by-product of matter, specifically brains?

In my youth, I would have answered, "Obviously thoughts are made of matter. You can prod a brain with electrical stimuli or drugs to provoke thoughts. Sleep supresses them and death extinguishes them. Everlasting spirits are wishful thinking!" In 2006 I was turning. I had talked to and really listened to people with different enough points of view to see that it wasn't just wishful thinking, even though it would be kind of nice not to die. Now I have to say, "Thoughts are primary. Whatever you might say about areas lighting up in my brain on an fMRI machine, you can't talk about that objective discovery without going through your own subjective thought process. You might conclude that my thoughts are mere spasms of neurons, but in doing so, you're asserting that your own thoughts aren't."

Subjectivity frames mathematical ideas and scientific discoveries as much as mathematical ideas can frame scientific discoveries. Science can't be practiced without math—every objective discovery about the world must be expressed in some sort of model—but neither can be practiced without storytelling, or the value judgement that some discoveries are more interesting than others, or the impetus to study anything or make any statements at all. Only "subjective nonsense" can be pure.

Worse still, this third category is the only one we can truly access: the reality of the physical world is a supposition in general, particular discoveries are always uncertain, and mathematical theorems can be mistaken. The existence of brains is more of an act of faith than the existence of spirit. If I know anything at all, I know that I am, but the existence of objects behind the sense-experience is a conjecture suggested by the consistency of those sense-experiences (to paraphrase Descartes). Plato gave the physical world a second-rate status to logic, but even logic is an ideal that we don't directly apprehend: how can I say that I've checked a proof carefully enough for the certainty that logic requires?
